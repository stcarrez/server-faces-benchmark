        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852),
        born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician
        and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer,
        the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm
        intended to be processed by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world's first
        computer programmer.
