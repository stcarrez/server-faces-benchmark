        <b>action</b>
        <i>MethodExpression</i>
        <span>MethodExpression representing the application action to invoke when this
            component is activated by the user. The expression must evaluate to a public
            method that takes no parameters, and returns an Object (the toString() of
            which is called to derive the logical outcome) which is passed to the
            NavigationHandler for this application.

    <li class="attr-unimpl">
        <b>actionListener</b>
        <i>MethodExpression</i>
        <span>MethodExpression representing an action listener method that will be notified
            when this component is activated by the user. The expression must evaluate to
            a public method that takes an ActionEvent parameter, with a return type of void,
            or to a public method that takes no arguments with a return type of void.
            In the latter case, the method has no way of easily knowing where the event came from,
            but this can be useful in cases where a notification is needed that "some action happened".
